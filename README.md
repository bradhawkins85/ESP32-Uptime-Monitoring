# ESP32 Uptime Monitor

A basic uptime monitor written for the ESP32. It was written for an XDA article.

It serves as a framework to monitor services where support can be hardcoded as a type, making it expandable. Users can also add their own GET requests and ping requests, so that it can support any service.

## Features

- **HTTP GET** requests with expected response validation
- **Ping** monitoring
- **SNMP GET** checks with comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, =, <>)
- **Pass/Fail Thresholds** - Configure how many consecutive successes or failures are required before changing a service's status and sending notifications
- Optional **ntfy offline notifications** when services go down
- Optional **Discord webhook notifications** for service up/down events
- Optional **SMTP email notifications** for service up/down events
- **RGB LED status indicator** - Visual feedback on system and service health
- **LCD and Touch Screen support** - Optional hardware display for viewing service status (on supported boards)
- Web-based UI for adding and managing services
- Persistent storage using LittleFS
- **Export/Import** monitor configurations for backup and restore
- **OTA Updates** - Update firmware via web interface without USB connection

## Supported Boards

The firmware supports multiple ESP32-S3 based boards. Select the appropriate environment when building with PlatformIO:

| Board | Environment | Display | Description |
|-------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1 N16R8 | `esp32-n16r8` | None | Standard ESP32-S3 development board with 16MB flash. RGB LED for status indication. |
| Guition ESP32-4848S040 | `esp32-4848S040` | 480x480 LCD + Touch | ESP32-S3 with 4" square IPS display and GT911 touch controller. Service status is shown on the display. |

### Building for a Specific Board

To build for a specific board, use the `-e` flag with the environment name:

```bash
# For ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1 N16R8 (no display)
pio run -e esp32-n16r8

# For Guition ESP32-4848S040 (with LCD and touch)
pio run -e esp32-4848S040
```

### LCD Display Features (ESP32-4848S040)

When using the Guition ESP32-4848S040 board, the firmware provides:

- **Service Status Display**: Shows the current service name, status (UP/DOWN), host information, and last check time
- **Touch Navigation**: Tap the left half of the screen to view the previous service, tap the right half for the next service
- **Auto-Rotation**: Automatically cycles through services every 8 seconds
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded status (green for UP, red for DOWN), with error messages displayed when available

## RGB LED Status Indicator

The ESP32-S3 DevKitC has a built-in RGB LED that provides visual feedback on system status. The LED indicates the following states:

| LED Color | Pattern | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Blue | Pulsing | **Booting** - System is starting up and has not yet performed any service checks |
| Orange | Steady | **No WiFi** - Unable to connect to the configured WiFi network |
| White | Steady | **MeshCore** - Communicating with MeshCore radio over BLE |
| Green | Pulsing | **All Up** - All monitored services are online and healthy |
| Red | Pulsing | **Service Down** - One or more monitored services are offline |

### Disabling the LED

The LED is enabled by default. To disable it, set the following in `src/config.cpp`:

```cpp
#define LED_ENABLED_VALUE false
```

Or provide it as a PlatformIO build flag:

```ini
build_flags =
    -DLED_ENABLED_VALUE=false
```

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the code to your ESP32 board, you need to have PlatformIO installed. There are two main ways to use PlatformIO:

### Option 1: VS Code with PlatformIO Extension (Recommended)

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "PlatformIO IDE" and install it
4. Restart VS Code when prompted

### Option 2: PlatformIO Core (CLI)

Install PlatformIO Core using pip:

```bash
pip install platformio
```

## Configuration

Before deploying, you need to configure your WiFi credentials:

1. Open `src/main.cpp`
2. Find the following lines near the top of the file:
   ```cpp
   const char* WIFI_SSID = "xxx";
   const char* WIFI_PASSWORD = "xxx";
   ```
3. Replace `"xxx"` with your actual WiFi network name and password:
   ```cpp
   const char* WIFI_SSID = "YourNetworkName";
   const char* WIFI_PASSWORD = "YourPassword";
   ```

### Protecting the web interface

Optional HTTP Basic Authentication can be enabled to prevent unauthenticated users from adding, importing, or deleting services.

Add the following values to `src/config.cpp` (or provide them via PlatformIO build flags) to require credentials when accessing the interface or modifying services:

```cpp
const char* WEB_AUTH_USERNAME = "admin";
const char* WEB_AUTH_PASSWORD = "strong-password";
```

### Pairing with MeshCore over BLE

The firmware now acts as a BLE **client** that connects to the Heltec T114 (MeshCore) using its advertised name and pairing PIN, then writes alert messages to the MeshCore inbox characteristic.

1. **Set the MeshCore peer name, PIN, and channel**
   - Edit `src/config.cpp` or provide build flags so the ESP32 knows how to reach the T114:
     ```cpp
     const char* BLE_PEER_NAME = "Heltec-T114";   // the T114's advertised name
     const uint32_t BLE_PAIRING_PIN = 123456;      // the MeshCore pairing PIN
     const char* BLE_MESH_CHANNEL_NAME = "alerts"; // channel to use on the T114 (must already exist on the device)
     // Optional: local name shown by the ESP32 itself
     const char* BLE_DEVICE_NAME = "ESP32-Uptime";
     ```
     ```ini
     ; platformio.ini
     -DBLE_PEER_NAME_VALUE=\"Heltec-T114\"
     -DBLE_PAIRING_PIN_VALUE=123456
     -DBLE_MESH_CHANNEL_NAME_VALUE=\"alerts\"
     -DBLE_DEVICE_NAME_VALUE=\"MyMeshBridge\"
     ```
   
   **Note:** The channel must be pre-configured on the MeshCore device before use. The ESP32 will not create or modify the channel.

2. **Flash the firmware and watch the serial monitor**
   - On boot the ESP32 scans for the MeshCore name. Logs will show `MeshCore peer found, attempting connection...` and `Connected to MeshCore peer...` once the link is up. If the peer is missing or the PIN is wrong, the error message appears in `/api/mesh/status`.

3. **Allow the ESP32 to initiate the connection**
   - Put the T114/MeshCore radio in pairing mode so it advertises with the configured name and accepts the PIN above. The ESP32 will pair, bond, and stay connected; the T114 does **not** subscribe to the ESP32.

4. **Triggering alerts to MeshCore**
   - The ESP32 acts as a client: it scans for the T114, pairs, and then writes alerts into the configured channel over the MeshCore characteristic. The channel must already exist on the MeshCore device.
   - You can also send ad-hoc messages via the web API (the ESP32 will connect first if needed):
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://<device-ip>/api/mesh/send \
       -u "<user>:<pass>" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"title":"Test","message":"Hello Mesh"}'
     ```
     Replace `<user>`/`<pass>` with your Basic Auth credentials (if enabled) and `<device-ip>` with the ESP32 IP address. The endpoint returns an error if the T114 cannot be found or paired.

### Enabling ntfy notifications

Set an ntfy topic to receive alerts whenever a monitored service goes offline. Optional bearer or basic authentication is also supported for secured ntfy servers.

1. In `src/main.cpp`, locate the ntfy configuration block:
   ```cpp
   const char* NTFY_SERVER = "https://ntfy.sh";
   const char* NTFY_TOPIC = "";
   const char* NTFY_ACCESS_TOKEN = "";
   const char* NTFY_USERNAME = "";
   const char* NTFY_PASSWORD = "";
   ```
2. Replace `NTFY_TOPIC` with your topic name (for self-hosted ntfy, update `NTFY_SERVER` as well). Provide authentication if required by your server:
   ```cpp
   const char* NTFY_SERVER = "https://ntfy.sh";
   const char* NTFY_TOPIC = "esp32-uptime";
   // use either a bearer token or basic auth credentials
   const char* NTFY_ACCESS_TOKEN = "my-token";
   // const char* NTFY_USERNAME = "user";
   // const char* NTFY_PASSWORD = "pass";
   ```
   3. Flash the firmware again. The device will publish a message to the topic whenever it detects that a service transitioned to a down state, and another when the service comes back online.

### Enabling Discord notifications

Send alerts to a Discord channel by configuring a webhook URL.

1. Create a webhook in your target Discord channel (Channel Settings → Integrations → Webhooks) and copy the webhook URL.
2. In `src/config.cpp`, set the webhook value:
   ```cpp
   const char* DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "";
   ```
   Replace the empty string with your webhook URL. You can also provide this at build time with a PlatformIO flag:
   ```ini
   -DDISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_VALUE=\"https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...\"
   ```
3. Rebuild and flash the firmware. A message will be sent to the webhook whenever a service changes state between up and down.

### Enabling SMTP notifications

Configure an SMTP relay to receive email alerts for uptime changes.

1. In `src/config.cpp`, set your SMTP details:
   ```cpp
   const char* SMTP_SERVER = "";
   const int SMTP_PORT = 587;
   const bool SMTP_USE_TLS = true;
   const char* SMTP_USERNAME = "";
   const char* SMTP_PASSWORD = "";
   const char* SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS = "";
   const char* SMTP_TO_ADDRESS = ""; // Comma-separated list is supported
   ```
2. For most servers you can provide the same values through PlatformIO build flags instead of editing the file directly:
   ```ini
   -DSMTP_SERVER_VALUE=\"smtp.example.com\"
   -DSMTP_PORT_VALUE=587
   -DSMTP_USE_TLS_VALUE=true
   -DSMTP_USERNAME_VALUE=\"user@example.com\"
   -DSMTP_PASSWORD_VALUE=\"password\"
   -DSMTP_FROM_ADDRESS_VALUE=\"monitor@example.com\"
   -DSMTP_TO_ADDRESS_VALUE=\"alerts@example.com\"
   ```
3. Rebuild and flash the firmware. The device will send an email whenever a service changes between up and down states. Multiple recipients can be provided as a comma-separated list.

### Enabling boot notifications

Optionally send a notification to all configured channels when the device boots up.

1. In `src/config.cpp`, find the boot notification configuration and change the default value:
   ```cpp
   #ifndef BOOT_NOTIFICATION_ENABLED_VALUE
   #define BOOT_NOTIFICATION_ENABLED_VALUE true  // Change from false to true
   #endif
   ```
2. Alternatively, enable via PlatformIO build flag (no file edits needed):
   ```ini
   -DBOOT_NOTIFICATION_ENABLED_VALUE=true
   ```
3. Rebuild and flash the firmware. When the device boots and connects to WiFi, it will send a notification to all configured channels (ntfy, Discord, SMTP, MeshCore) indicating that the monitor has started and showing the device IP address.

## Deploying to ESP32

### Connect Your ESP32 Board

1. Connect your ESP32 board to your computer using a USB cable. Supported boards include:
   - ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1-N16R8 (environment: `esp32-n16r8`)
   - Guition ESP32-4848S040 with 480x480 LCD (environment: `esp32-4848S040`)
2. The board should be automatically detected by your system
3. On Linux, you may need to add your user to the `dialout` group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
   ```
   Log out and back in for the changes to take effect.

### Using VS Code with PlatformIO IDE

1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Wait for PlatformIO to initialize (you'll see a progress indicator in the status bar)
3. Click the PlatformIO icon in the left sidebar
4. Under "Project Tasks", select your board environment (`esp32-n16r8` or `esp32-4848S040`):
   - Click **Build** to compile the firmware
   - Click **Upload** to flash the firmware to your ESP32
   - Click **Monitor** to view serial output

Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcuts:
- **Ctrl+Alt+B** (Cmd+Alt+B on Mac): Build
- **Ctrl+Alt+U** (Cmd+Alt+U on Mac): Upload

### Using PlatformIO CLI

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
# Build the firmware (builds all environments by default)
pio run

# Build for a specific board
pio run -e esp32-n16r8         # For ESP32-S3 DevKitC (no display)
pio run -e esp32-4848S040      # For Guition ESP32-4848S040 (with LCD)

# Upload to the ESP32 (specify environment with -e)
pio run -e esp32-n16r8 --target upload

# Monitor serial output
pio device monitor
```

Or combine build and upload in one command:

```bash
pio run -e esp32-n16r8 --target upload && pio device monitor
```

## Monitoring Serial Output

After uploading, open the serial monitor to view debug information and the IP address of your ESP32:

- **VS Code**: Click "Monitor" in the PlatformIO sidebar
- **CLI**: Run `pio device monitor`

The monitor is configured to run at 115200 baud rate.

You should see output similar to:

```
Starting ESP32 Uptime Monitor...
LittleFS mounted successfully
Connecting to WiFi...
...
WiFi connected!
IP address: 192.168.1.100
Web server started
System ready!
Access web interface at: http://192.168.1.100
```

## Accessing the Web Interface

Once the ESP32 is running and connected to your WiFi:

1. Note the IP address shown in the serial monitor
2. Open a web browser on a device connected to the same network
3. Navigate to `http://<ESP32_IP_ADDRESS>` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100`)
4. Use the web interface to add and manage monitoring services

## Backup and Restore Monitor Configurations

The web interface provides export and import functionality to backup and restore your monitor configurations. This is useful when:

- Performing firmware updates that may reset the filesystem
- Migrating configurations to a different ESP32 device
- Creating backups before making changes

### Exporting Monitors

1. Click the **Export Monitors** button in the web interface
2. A JSON file (`monitors-backup.json`) will be downloaded containing all your service configurations
3. Store this file safely for future restoration

### Importing Monitors

1. Click the **Import Monitors** button in the web interface
2. Select a previously exported JSON backup file
3. The services will be added to your current configuration
4. A message will indicate how many services were imported

**Note:** Importing adds services to existing ones rather than replacing them. If you want to start fresh, delete existing services before importing.

## OTA (Over-The-Air) Updates

The ESP32 Uptime Monitor supports firmware updates via the web interface, eliminating the need for a USB connection after initial deployment.

### Updating Firmware via OTA

1. Build your new firmware binary using PlatformIO:
   ```bash
   pio run
   ```
2. The compiled binary will be located at `.pio/build/esp32-n16r8/firmware.bin`
3. Open the web interface in your browser
4. Click the **OTA Update** button in the header (opens in a new tab)
5. On the ElegantOTA page, click "Firmware" and select your `firmware.bin` file
6. Click "Update" to begin the firmware upload
7. Wait for the upload to complete and the device to reboot

**Note:** Your monitor configurations (services) are stored in LittleFS and will persist across firmware updates.

### Generating OTA-compatible Binaries

For OTA updates, you only need the `firmware.bin` file. This is automatically generated when you build the project:

```bash
# Build firmware for your board
pio run -e esp32-n16r8         # For ESP32-S3 DevKitC
pio run -e esp32-4848S040      # For Guition ESP32-4848S040

# The binary is at:
# .pio/build/esp32-n16r8/firmware.bin       (for esp32-n16r8)
# .pio/build/esp32-4848S040/firmware.bin    (for esp32-4848S040)
```

### Security Considerations

- If HTTP Basic Authentication is enabled (via `WEB_AUTH_USERNAME` and `WEB_AUTH_PASSWORD`), the same credentials are required to access the OTA update page at `/update`
- If authentication is not configured, the OTA update page will be accessible without credentials
- Consider restricting network access to the ESP32 if security is a concern
- Always backup your monitor configurations before performing firmware updates

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Failed

- Ensure the USB cable supports data transfer (not just charging)
- Try a different USB port
- Hold the BOOT button on the ESP32 while initiating upload
- Check that no other application is using the serial port

### WiFi Connection Failed

- Verify your SSID and password are correct
- Ensure your WiFi network is 2.4GHz (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
- Check that the ESP32 is within range of your router

### Serial Monitor Shows Garbage Characters

- Ensure the baud rate is set to 115200
- Try resetting the ESP32 board

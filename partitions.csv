# Partition table for ESP32-S3 with LittleFS support
# Note: The partition is named 'spiffs' because the Arduino ESP32 LittleFS library
# looks for a partition with this name by default when calling LittleFS.begin().
# Despite the name, LittleFS (not SPIFFS) is used as the filesystem.
# Sized at ~12MB (0xBF0000) to fit within a 16MB flash layout with OTA partitions.

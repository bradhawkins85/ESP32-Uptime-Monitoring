# Partition table for Heltec Wireless Stick Lite V3 (8MB flash)
# Note: The partition is named 'spiffs' because the Arduino ESP32 LittleFS library
# looks for a partition with this name by default when calling LittleFS.begin().
# Despite the name, LittleFS (not SPIFFS) is used as the filesystem.
# Optimized for 8MB flash with OTA support and data storage.
